	\subsection{Narrative perspective / point of view}

	\subsubsection{Different narrators}

	\paragraph{First person narrator}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item "I", "We", "Our" etc.
		\item better knowledge about the narrator
		\item less knowledge about / insight into other characters
		\item only one (maybe biased) perspective
	\end{itemize}

	\paragraph{Third person limited narrator}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item focused on one ccaracter
		\item same knowledge as first person narrator (insight etc)
		\item deeper experience
		\item distance to other characters
	\end{itemize}

	\paragraph{Third person omniscient narrator}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item freed from one character
		\item freed from time (time jumps, flashbacks)
		\item opinions from both the narrator and the characters
		\item knows more than the characters
		\item god-like view
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Effects of different narrative perspectives}

	\paragraph{Suspense}
	Sometimes the omniscient third person narrator tells the reader something the character learns later in the story. The reader therefore waits for this point, which creates a spencial tension that makes the reader want to know more about the continuation of the story.

	\subsubsection{Tense}
	The tense of a text is also important for the narrative perspective. A text that is written in the present creates a more immersive feeling for the reader. Together with a first person or third person limited narrator, the reader feels like he is a part of the story.
	A past tense on the other hand brings some sort of distance into the text and enables the narrator to evaluate events that took place in the past and influence the current life of some characters.

	\subsubsection{Focus on main character}
	It also occurs that the first person / third person limited narrator does not focus on teh main character. This is also interesting, as the narrator is able to judge the protagonists actions.

	\subsection{Style and tone}

	\subsubsection{Style}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the ways in which something is written
		\item also includes choice of words and tone
		\item how is the information presented?
		\item to what extent is the style appropriate for the audience / the arguments?
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Choice of words / diction}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item formal/casual/informal words
		\item positive / negative connotated word
		\item vague
		\item overly complex
		\item repetition of certain words
	\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Tone}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item subjective / objective
		\item logical / emotional
		\item intimate / distant
		\item serious / humorous
		\item long / short / varying sentences
		\item funny, familiar
	\end{itemize}
